ORM is used to map the objects to database table
Object Card(card_number, cvv) -> cards table

The only drawback of ORM over Native sql is latency because the java code is converted to sql by ORM.

ORM (1. Jav code, 2. sql) (Hibernate) / Native SQL (1. direct sql)
JPA - Specification

> @SneakyThrows annotation.

> What is DTO pattern ?

> What is the difference between orElse(null) and orElseGet(null) ?
read also orElseThrow().

> What are the strategies of @GeneratedValue annotation ?

> What is the characteristics of Entity class (in which cases @Entity annotation can be used) ?

> Two tables are created by Liquibase - databasechangelog and databasechangeloglock
databasechangelog stores the information when the query executed. It has a column md5sum which generates a unique id.
when something is changed in changelog files, it will throw error because md5sum ids will not match.

> Three interfaces for Repository.

> @Repository annotation can handle SQL Exception

> Communication between microservices - REST, Queue (MessageBrocker).
